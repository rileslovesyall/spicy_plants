## FAQ

**Why is this called Spicy Plants?**
Because my last name is Spicer, & I thought we would spice things up.

**How do I win the game?**
You don't. Living things are an obligation you took on, so you now are tethered to your plants until the end.

**What is the meaning of life?**
While this is frequently asked, it is not frequently answered, and this will not be the exception to the rule.
